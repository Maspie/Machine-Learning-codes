## Machine Learning Codes

Different Machine Learning codes-


### Generic K-Means
- Load and Prepare Data:
Import libraries and load dataset. Select Column1 and Column2 for clustering.

- Elbow Method:
Calculate WCSS for 1-10 clusters to find the optimal number. Plot WCSS to identify the elbow point.

-  Optimal Clustering:
Choose 5 clusters based on the elbow graph. Apply K-Means clustering to the data.

- Visualize Clusters:
Plot data points color-coded by cluster and highlight centroids in red.

This approach unveils hidden patterns and structures in your data efficiently.
